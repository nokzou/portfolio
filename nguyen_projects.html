            <p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2"> Class: CSE </br>Date: Sep 8, 2017</br>"Dodge the Cars" was my first project, and was a game that I made using MIT's Scratch website. My main goal was to simply
            make a replayable game with simple mechanics, but a great difficulty. I came up with these ideas based on the average popular smartphone game like
            Flappy Bird or Crossy Road, as they have constant, repeated mechanics that progressively get harder over time. As my first start, I tried to focus
            on the foundational aspect rather than trying to mesh out everything that I had imagined when designing the game. I tried to develop good programming
            habits using my experience in creating this game rather than take a huge leap into programming.</br> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173696271/">Link</a></p>

            . This was my first good experience being able to collaborate with another programmer and we were able to combine creative ideas to improve our game on
            multiple occasions. Most of this project was actually already set up with the basic mechanics already done, but it was up to us to come up with a way to make
            the game better. It was a good opportunity to review and look over another person's work, building up collaborative skills.</p>

            We both worked on the code together, but my specific job was to create a repeatable function that we could use to offer the users different options that they could input to reach another set of choices that would keep going
            on until they reached an ending of the adventure. This project helped me develop a better understanding of Python and the usage of flowcharts to help me organize my project development.</p>

            <p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2">Class: CSE </br>Date: Feb 1, 2018</br>Our “Hangman” project was made with Python. I created it in collaboration with Sahithi Samsani, like I did with the
            previous project. My main job in this project was to develop a looping function that would essentially play Hangman with the user by generating a random word, asking them to input letters, and showing the parts of the
            word that they had guessed correctly. I also made ASCII art to show on each turn. Through programming this project, I, again, improved my understanding of Python and worked on my ability to collaboratively program with
            another person at the same time on the same file.</p>

            I worked with Soleiman Qazi to finish this project. My main job in this project was coming up with ideas, creating the functions that the user would use, the documentation and usage of comments to aid in understanding
            and revision, and catching bugs/errors. Through this project, I developed my understanding of using third-party modules to achieve my goals, and my understanding of the importance of comments and documentation while
            revising or going through code. </p>
