            <p style="float:left; width:65%; margin:1rem; line-height: 2"> Class: CSE </br>Date: Sep 8, 2017</br>"Dodge the Cars" was my first project, and was a game that I made using MIT's Scratch website. My main goal was to simply
            make a replayable game with simple mechanics, but a great difficulty. I came up with these ideas based on the average popular smartphone game like
            Flappy Bird or Crossy Road, as they have constant, repeated mechanics that progressively get harder over time. As my first start, I tried to focus
            on the foundational aspect rather than trying to mesh out everything that I had imagined when designing the game. I tried to develop good programming
            habits using my experience in creating this game rather than take a huge leap into programming.</p>

            . This was my first good experience being able to collaborate with another programmer and we were able to combine creative ideas to improve our game on
            multiple occasions. Most of this project was actually already set up with the basic mechanics already done, but it was up to us to come up with a way to make
            the game better. It was a good opportunity to review and look over another person's work, building up collaborative skills.</p>
