                    Innovation. That's the future of our world. That's what I'd love to do. Creating things and watching them work
                    has always been my passion, and that's what I'd love to work at as a career. People often take one way to fix a problem
                    , but I believe that there's always multiple methods for one goal. I do this to keep an open mind, something a lot of
                    us struggle with these days. An open mind and a positive attitude are all that I need in life. It's not easy to innovate, though.
                    It takes a special person to come up with new, creative ideas, and often even they fail. If I want to pursue innovation
                    in my career, then I'll have to gain experience and face failure over and over, and that's what I'm perfectly ready to do.

                    I'm truly grateful to have been born in my generation. I grew up never knowing what it was like
                    to not have computers, which led to their importance in my childhood. Around the age of seven, I
                    built my first PC with my dad using old, leftover parts and some new, cheap ones from the nearby Frys.
                    I failed over and over. but the moment that I succeeded was the sweetest victory of my life. Spending time
                    and work on a creation and being able to watch it work is something truly indescribable. It's an
                    amazing thing when a person is perseverant, and that's what I strive to be.
                    The first thing I ever did with that computer was play video games and marvel at the idea that the project that 
                    I had just finished was able to do something so complex. I've built two more computers (for myself) ever since, but I never
                    really stuck to the hardware side of things. I always found the software to be far more interesting. I
                    spend a large amount of my time playing video games, exploring the creations of others, and oftentimes
                    I wish I was the creator, and that's what computer science can allow me to be.

                    As a Taekwondo assistant instructor, I've learned what it's like to work with others and teach them new skills. To truly learn
                    something, you must be able to teach it. This works both ways and helps me teach others and learn things quickly, as I hope it can
                    benefit anyone reading this. As a Cross-Country athlete, I've experienced how perseverance and time can change you. I increased my 2.25
                    mile time by over 2 minutes in the course of 3 months, but that's not what I truly gained from Cross-Country. I gained perseverance and
                    patience, two things that should be important to everybody. As a Boy Scout, I've learned leadership. Spending countless days out in the
                    wilderness leading hikes or camping trips helped me understand what a leader should be. A good leader should set an example that others
                    can follow while making sure everybody does their job. You have to make sure everybody understands and that everybody can do their job,
                    because if they can't, then you're not doing yours.
